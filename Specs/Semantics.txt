Statements Must end with SemiColon
Variables Always Declared before Use
Variables should never be ReDeclared within same scope
Functions must always define return type
Functions with non-void return types must always return data
Const Variables should never be changed
ParenthesizedExpressions must always contain Expressions: Example->ControlStatement, IterationStatements ()
Function Parameters Do Not Have to Follow ParenthesizedExpressions Rules because func() is not an expression, its a statement list (int x1, int x2) etc...
ControlStatement and IterationStatement Bodies are Optional
Function Body is not optional (Might Change, Function Definition/Declarations/Forward Declaring?)
